Learning-Modding---Mod
======================

This mod is how I am learning modding by experimentation and following tutorials. 
Examples of these tutorials are VSWE's lectures , Minecraft Forge Wiki Tutorials and Pahimars Lets Mod Series.
Some of the Methods I use may be similar or the same as these tutorials and I do not intend to copy there work and claim ownership.
Some of the textures I have Made However some of them come from the tutorials and belong to their original owners (most are from VSWE's lectures).
Feel free to use the code here and learn from it.
